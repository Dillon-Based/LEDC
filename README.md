# LEDC

This repository contains a small Airtable automation script. The script checks a record in the **Individual Gives** table and, when a condition is met, creates a related record in **Benefits Owed**.

## Running tests

A simple test suite is provided to exercise the automation logic with mocked Airtable tables. Run it with Node:

```bash
node airtable.test.js
```
